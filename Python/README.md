# Python Sample Code for CS765 Design Challenge 3

This code was written by Mike Gleicher for the class to reference.

You are welcome to use it as part of your assignments.

All of this was done with Python 3.6

The code is not the prettiest, it was done in a hurry. But it should be simple enough to get the point across.

What's here:

* exampleReader.py - simplest program to read a JSON data file and show some statistics. Mainly useful to show you how to get at the data.
* example.py - simplest visualization that reads a JSON file and writes out an SVG table
* gradebook.py - simple random data generator, useful for testing. Note that in the future, a fancier data generator will make more realistic data (with things in it to find)
* random_names.txt - a list of random names generated by a web tool I found (http://listofrandomnames.com/)
